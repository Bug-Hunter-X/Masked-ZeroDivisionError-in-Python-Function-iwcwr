This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python that can be easily overlooked. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle a potential `ZeroDivisionError`, but its handling is flawed. This leads to the program continuing execution without raising the exception, thereby masking the error and making it difficult to identify. The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code.  The solution is presented in `bugSolution.py`, showing how to appropriately handle the division by zero.
